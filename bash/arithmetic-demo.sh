# Task 1: Remove the assignments of numbers to the first and second number variables. Use one or more read commands to get 3 numbers from the user.
# Task 2: Change the output to only show:
#    the sum of the 3 numbers with a label
#    the product of the 3 numbers with a label

cat <<EOF
The sum of $firstnum , $secondnum and $thirdnum numbers is $sum .
The product of $firstnum , $secondnum and $thirdnum numbers is $multiply .
